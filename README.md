# Traffic Congestion Forecasting with ARIMA in Python

Traffic congestion forecasting with ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) in Python is a powerful technique for predicting future traffic congestion levels. By analyzing historical traffic data, this project provides insights into traffic patterns and forecasts congestion levels for different time periods, aiding in traffic management and route optimization.

## Introduction to ARIMA Forecasting

ARIMA is a time series forecasting model that captures trends and seasonality in data. By fitting an ARIMA model to historical traffic data, we can forecast future traffic congestion levels with accuracy. This technique is invaluable for city planners, transportation authorities, and commuters to make informed decisions about travel routes and timings.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Statsmodels

### Quick Start Guide

**1. Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/arima-traffic-forecast.git
cd arima-traffic-forecast
```

**2. Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install pandas numpy statsmodels
```

**3. Run the Application:**

```bash
python traffic_forecast.py
Run and Test
```

Follow the instructions in the application to input your historical traffic data and configure the ARIMA model parameters. Once configured, the application will generate forecasts for future traffic congestion levels based on the provided data.
